# Sensor for the autonomy ledger — the series the kaizen judge (I13.3) will read.
#
# The ledger records FACTS, never a score, and its value is entirely in being trustworthy: a row
# that should not exist (a projection, a fixture) poisons a metric that decides whether the kit
# graduates. So the assertions here are mostly about what must NOT be written.
#
# Hermetic: `claude` is stubbed and SDD_STATE_DIR points inside the fixture — `gh` is never called
# on the paths this test exercises. Runs INSIDE mutants (unlike check-preflight), because the
# mutations that sabotage the writer have to kill the sandbox suite — guarded, they would score a
# point for nothing.
#
# Usage: tests/check-autonomy.sh   (exit 0 = the ledger tells the truth)
